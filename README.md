# 💻 Full-Stack .gitignore Template

**(React + Node.js + Express + MongoDB + TypeScript + pnpm + Mongoose + Tailwind CSS)**

A professionally curated `.gitignore` template for **modern full-stack JavaScript projects**.
It covers both **frontend** (**React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**) and **backend** (**Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Mongoose**) setups.

> **Note:** This template includes ignores for **pnpm-related files** (like cache, lock files, etc.) to prevent them from being pushed to GitHub. It does **not** include files for other package managers like npm or Yarn.

---

## 💻 Overview

This repository provides a ready-to-use `.gitignore` file that:

* Prevents sensitive files such as `.env` from being pushed to GitHub
* Covers **frontend and backend structures** in a single setup
* Includes ignores for **pnpm-specific files**
* Ideal for **MERN developers**, **freelancers**, and **open-source projects**

You can simply copy this `.gitignore` file into your project or use it as a base template for your next full-stack build.
