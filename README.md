# 🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Ignore Templates

A professionally curated repository of `.gitignore` and `.prettierignore` templates for **modern full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript projects**.  
This repository helps developers maintain **clean, secure, and well-formatted codebases** by excluding unnecessary, sensitive, or generated files from Git and Prettier.

> **Purpose:** These `.gitignore` and `.prettierignore` files help you exclude unnecessary, sensitive, or system-generated files from being pushed to GitHub, keeping your repository clean and secure.

> **Note:** This template includes ignores for **pnpm-package manager-related files** (like cache, lock files, etc.) to prevent them from being pushed to GitHub. It does **not** include files for other package managers like npm or Yarn.

## 📌 Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the template files**  
   Copy `.gitignore` and/or `.prettierignore` into the **root directory** of your project.

2. **Customize if needed**  
   Modify the files to fit your project structure or technology stack.

3. **Commit safely**  
   With these templates, you can avoid committing unwanted files, keeping your Git history clean.

4. **Prettier integration**  
   If using Prettier in VSCode or via CLI, `.prettierignore` ensures generated files, caches, and outputs remain untouched.
